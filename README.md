# Quantum Logic Gates Exercises

## Objectives
Acquire skills in using basic quantum gates, understanding quantum state evolution, Bell states, and implementing a quantum incrementer.

## Guidelines

### Exercise 1
Implement four quantum circuits to evolve the system to each of the four Bell states. Describe the evolution step by step in Dirac notation and matrix form. Implement circuits using QISKIt Quantum Lab and verify results.

### Exercise 2
Implement four-qubit circuits that add values 1 to 8 to the quantum register. Verify functionality using QISKit Quantum Lab.

### Exercise 3
Implement the quantum teleportation algorithm in Python to teleport the state of Alice's qubit to Bob's qubit. The state is determined by angles 𝜃 and 𝜙 on the Bloch sphere.
